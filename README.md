I created an app that will tell how many Krabby Patties have been devoured at Eat da BUrger.  I created a table that lists how many veggie, cheese and bacon patties will be eaten using my MySql workbench.  I created a connection that would connect all of my packages tables and routes together in order to create the app in the most functing way possible.  I not only created a Github repository, but I also created a Heroku Jaws db app to deploy my app to both Heroku and Github before I submit the assignment.
